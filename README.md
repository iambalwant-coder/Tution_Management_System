# Student Management System

## Project Description

The **Student Management System** is a Django-based web application designed to efficiently manage student records. The system allows users to add, edit, delete, and view student details, with the added functionality of tracking student fees. The application features a simple interface for the management of student information, including basic personal details, fee information, and a functionality for deleting or editing student records.

### Key Features:
1. **Home Page**: Displays a list of all students, showing their basic details such as student ID, name, age, gender, total fees, and paid fees.
2. **Add Student**: Allows administrators to add a new student by inputting the student's personal information and fee details. The data is stored in the database.
3. **Edit Student Details**: Enables the modification of existing student records, including their name, age, gender, and fee details.
4. **Delete Student**: Allows administrators to remove a student record from the database.
5. **Fee Management**: The system tracks the total fee and the paid fee, providing an overview of the student's financial status.
6. **View Student Details**: Admins can view detailed student information including their name, ID, age, gender, total fee, and paid fee.

### Functionalities:

1. **Home Page**:
   - The `home_views` function retrieves and displays all student records from the database, showcasing the student's ID, name, age, gender, and financial information (total and paid fees).

2. **Add Student**:
   - The `add1_views` function provides a form to add new students. The form captures student details such as student ID, name, age, gender, total fee, and paid fee. Once the form is filled out and validated, the student information is saved in the database.

3. **Edit Student**:
   - The `edit_views` function allows editing of student information. Users can modify student details (like name, age, gender, etc.). After changes are made, the updated data is saved back to the database.

4. **Delete Student**:
   - The `delete1_views` function allows the deletion of a student from the system based on their student ID. It also logs the deleted student’s details before removing them from the database.
   - The `delete2_views` function provides an additional way to delete a student by their ID.

5. **Fee Tracking**:
   - Each student record includes details about the total fee and the amount of paid fee. This functionality is useful for keeping track of the student's financial status.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Django (Python web framework) for building the application's server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS for building the user interface.
- **Database**: SQLite (default database in Django) to store student and fee information.
- **Form Handling**: The project uses Django forms (`StudentForm`) to handle user input and validation.

### Workflow of the Application:

1. **Home Page**:
   - All student records are displayed on the home page. This includes details like student name, ID, age, gender, total fees, and paid fees.
2. **Add New Student**:
   - The admin can add a new student via a form on the "Add Student" page. The student’s ID, name, age, gender, total fee, and paid fee are captured, stored in the database, and reflected on the homepage.
3. **Edit Student**:
   - Admins can select a student and modify their information. After editing, the updated details are saved to the database.
4. **Delete Student**:
   - Admins can delete a student’s record either via the "Delete" page, where a student’s ID is selected, or directly from the student details page.
5. **Fee Information**:
   - Each student’s financial information, including the total fee and the paid fee, is stored and displayed.

### Benefits of the System:
- **Efficient Record Management**: The system makes it easy to add, edit, and manage student details.
- **Fee Tracking**: The fee information helps in keeping track of how much fee has been paid and how much is pending.
- **Simple Interface**: The application offers a straightforward interface, making it easy for administrators to manage student data without needing technical expertise.
- **Data Integrity**: The use of forms ensures that only valid data is saved, preventing errors in student records.
- **Ease of Access**: With features like searching, adding, editing, and deleting student records, the system is convenient for administrators and staff.
